# Battleships Game

This is a Python program that allows two players to play the Battleships game on separate grids. Each player's fleet of battleships is marked on their own grid. Players take turns guessing the locations of the opponent's battleships, aiming to destroy the entire fleet.

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

3. Enter the names of the two players and the number of battleships to place on the grid.

4. Players take turns guessing the coordinates to hit the opponent's battleships. The grid will be displayed, showing your own grid and the enemy grid. Feedback will be provided on whether the guess was a hit or a miss.

5. Continue guessing until you destroy all the opponent's battleships or until the game ends.

6. The game will declare a winner once all battleships for either you or your opponent are sunk.

## Technologies Used

1. Python
2. Git

## Testing

1. The code has been tested on various scenarios to ensure correct behavior and accurate gameplay.
2. I have tested for incorrect input data eg, the number being greater or smaller than the grid requirements and only being able to input numbers and not words.
3. All features of game can be seen tested in features section above.

## Known Issues

No known issues at the moment.
